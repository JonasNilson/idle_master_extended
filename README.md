 ⭐️ Accepted by the official [Idle Master community](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/idlemastery/discussions/0/1485487749771924917/)
 
This is a fork of the original [Idle Master](https://github.com/jshackles/idle_master) project (**discontinued** in early 2017) by [jshackles](https://github.com/jshackles) (also known for [Enhanced Steam](https://github.com/jshackles/Enhanced_Steam)).

Features
-------
Idle Master Extended comes with a few extensions and fixes:

* **Fast mode** (File > Settings > Fast mode): Get your cards faster by automagically switching between simultaneous and individual idling (based on: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/idlemastery/discussions/0/1485487749771924917/)

* **Dark theme** (File > Settings > Dark theme): Applies color changes to several of the interface components to better match the Steam interface color scheme.

</p>

* **Updated Steamworks.NET** (https://steamworks.github.io): Includes the latest version of Steamworks.NET (v11.0.0) (available here: https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/releases), which no longer requires CSteamworks.dll.

* **Cookies and HTTPS**: All links within the application uses the HTTPS protocol and the cookie has been updated to include *steamLoginSecure*. The browser window used to login to Steam displays more information about the site being visited.

* **Additional fixes**: For example, previously the "current badge" was skipped when changing from individual game idling to simultaneous idling - it should now work as intended. 

*Note*: the "Remember me on this computer" checkbox is automatically checked when using the login browser window due to user feedback. According to the Steam website this allows for automatic logins for **30 days** - but it is only valid for Steam Guard enabled users.

*The following was included in the original Idle Master README:*

Idle Master
===========

This program will determine which of your Steam games still have Steam Trading Card drops remaining, and will go through each application to simulate you being “in-game” so that cards will drop.  It will check periodically to see if the game you’re idling has card drops remaining.  When only one drop remains, it will start checking more frequently.  When the game you’re idling has no more cards, it’ll move on to the next game.  When no more cards are available, the program will terminate.

**This project has been discontinued**, no further bug fixes or changes will be made.  Issues and pull requests will be ignored.  The program should still work (as of Jan 3, 2018) but Valve may make a change that causes the program to become non-functioning at any time.  There are a multitude of forks of this project that are being currently maintained.
